title: Austin Code Camp 2011
---

It was a pleasure to both attend and speak at "Austin Code Camp":http://adnug.github.com/code-camp-2011/ this year. I couldn't _possibly_ have had a better response to my first talk, *"Seven Soft Skills for Super Sexy Salaries"*! If you attended my first talk, thank you so much for all of the positive feedback, and all of the great questions!

h2. Whoops!

Unfortunately, I experienced some technical difficulties whilst giving my second talk, *"Let's create a programming language!"*. Because of that, I will be recording and uploading the presentation over the next couple days.

For the curious, ANTLRWorks was invoking <code>javac</code>, which in turn failed with <code>javac: file not found: <path-to-file></code>. Of course, the file that <code>javac</code> was complaining about was generated _by_ ANTLRWorks and _was_ there, in plain sight. Something was utterly confused. I rebooted and, like magic, ANTLRWorks was working fine...

*Note to self:* when preparing a presentation, use the same computer you plan to bring with you - crazy shit happens!
