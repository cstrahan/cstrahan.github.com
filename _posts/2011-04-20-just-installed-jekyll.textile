title: From Wordpress to Jekyll

h2. {{ page.title }}

I've finally decided to ditch "Wordpress":http://wordpress.org/ for "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/. I _really_ don't see the point in using a full-fledged blogging platform if you're seasoned developer -- there's just _way_ too much bloat to sift through.

h3. How is this any better?

What do I like about it? Well, it's pretty easy to get started (aside from seting up "Pygments":http://pygments.org/ on Windows)[1], and all of my posts are contained in "textile formatted":http://redcloth.org/textile files -- for example, this "here":https://github.com/cstrahan/cstrahan.github.com/raw/master/_posts/2011-04-20-just-installed-jekyll.textile is the textile file for this very page. Of course, all of my posts are version controlled using "Git":http://git-scm.com/, and my site is "built and hosted on GitHub":http://pages.github.com/#using_jekyll_for_complex_layouts.

h3. Dude, I'm sold!

Sweet! Here are some tips for you "after you've installed Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki.
