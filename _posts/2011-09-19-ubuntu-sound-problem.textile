title: No Sound from Headphones on Ubuntu
---

On my Compaq Presario (Model: SR5152NX, Soundcard: ALC888), the headphone jack wasn't working. I tried screwing around with <code>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</code> by adding <code>options snd-hda-intel model=MODEL</code> (where <code>MODEL</code> was one of _many_ models I tried)... and I managed to get audio coming out of _both_ jacks at one point, which still wasn't right.

Finally, I reverted all of my changes and tried this out:

<pre class="console">
# Let's get the latest ALSA drivers:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-alsa-driver-modules-$(uname -r)

# Reboot :)
</pre>

Et voilã , audio works flawlessly now.
