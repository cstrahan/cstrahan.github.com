This was a royal pain in the ass to figure out, so hopefully this'll save you or someone else some time. What follows is pretty much copied verbatim from the following site: 
"http://www.noah.org/wiki/SSH_public_keys":http://www.noah.org/wiki/SSH_public_keys

*Note to Windows/msysgit users:* the following commands will work without a hitch if you run them from the "GIT Bash". Otherwise, you'll need to ensure that openssl is on your PATH. I'm assuming here that your key is located at <code>%userprofile%/.ssh/id_rsa</code>.

h2. Unencrypt your existing key

If your existing key is encrypted (read: has a password), you'll need to remove the encryption first (this will obviously overwrite the existing key file): 

<pre class="console">
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>

h2. Encrypt your existing key

Once you've unencrypted your key, you'll need to re-encrypt it (this will obviously overwrite the existing key file): 

<pre class="console">
openssl rsa -des3 -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>

When you run the above command, you'll be prompted for your new password.
